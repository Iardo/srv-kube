## How to use

1. Run `./main.py` without arguments to generate the configurations files
2. To install a service just uncomment the one that you want in the `service-list.yml` and run `./main.sh sync`

The `service-sync.yml` is auto-managed by the application to keep track of the installations, do not make changes to it manually.

## Disable service

Comment out the one that you want disabled in the `service-list.yml` and run `./main.sh sync`, if the services was previously installed then is going to be marked as disabled inside `service-sync.yml` but keeping their directory in intact.

## Clean-up services

If you want to get rid of disabled services directories inside `./installed` run `./main.py clean`.
